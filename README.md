This is a minimal AGS Plugin to bring Steam and GOG functionality. Any additional store required please open an issue so it can be discussed.

**NOTE:** NDA guarded integrations cannot be added here as this is a public source code.

This plugin will attempt to be compatible with AGS2Client, AGSteam and AGSGalaxy, with new features added through a simpler api.

An effort should be done to support at minimum

- achievements,
- leaderboards,
- stats,
- friends.

- look into steamdeck stuff for steam

Additional features may be store specific, and will be added later.
